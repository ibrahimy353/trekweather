The following project, is a representation of the weather-app that I created using HTML,CSS and Javascript . 
the purpose of the app is to showcase the exact climantic conditions of a particular city.
I used weather API from weather open weather source (http://openweather.org/) to be able to fetch data from there server and into my site.
i also used unsplashed background API to change the background image of the site. The background image is always related to the city one gets to search for.
